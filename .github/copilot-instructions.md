Use poetry to manage python dependencies and Docker for containerization. Always generate and update the poetry.lock file after modifying dependencies.

When making changes to command arguments keep the `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `README.md` in sync.

Always include type hinting in python files for better code clarity and maintainability.

Generate python code adhering to pep8 standards and include docstrings for all functions and classes.
