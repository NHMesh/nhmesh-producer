## Usage

## Resilience Features

### Connection Management

- **Automatic reconnection** with exponential backoff
- **Health monitoring** every 30 seconds
- **Thread-safe operations** with proper locking
- **Graceful shutdown** with resource cleanup

### Error Handling

- **BrokenPipeError handling** for TCP connection failures
- **MQTT reconnection** on unexpected disconnections
- **Packet processing isolation** - errors don't crash the app
- **Fallback mechanisms** when services are unavailable

### Monitoring

- **Detailed logging** of connection events and recovery
- **Health check metrics** for connection quality
- **Error tracking** for adaptive behavior
- **Performance monitoring** with minimal overhead

## Testing

Run the resilience tests to verify the improvements:

```bash
python test_connection_resilience.py
```

The test suite verifies:

- Connection failure handling
- Reconnection logic
- Error isolation
- Graceful shutdown

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection failures**:

   - Check network connectivity to the Meshtastic node
   - Verify the node IP address is correct
   - Check firewall settings

2. **Frequent reconnections**:

   - Increase health check interval for less aggressive monitoring
   - Check network stability
   - Verify node is not rebooting frequently

3. **MQTT publish failures**:
   - Check MQTT broker connectivity
   - Verify credentials are correct
   - Check network connectivity to broker

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed connection information:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python -m nhmesh_producer.producer --node-ip 192.168.1.100
```
